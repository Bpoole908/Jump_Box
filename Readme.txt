**Description**
In this game, the player is a box that must navigate around artificially intelligent enemies and rotating blades to get through all the levels with as few deaths possible.
In each level, the goal is to successfully reach the exit dying as few times as possible by avoiding collision with enemies and rotating blades.
In order to navigate these levels walling jumping will need to be performed. This can be done by being next to a wall and pressing the jump button(space).
Enemies are designated by gray coloring and will chase when you get too close.
The exit to each level will be through a black door that will lead to the next level. You can enter this door by pressing 'W' when you are on top of it.
Only after the player has successfully navigated through the obstacles and enemies will the player be find a black door and advance through the game.
If the player is killed, the death counter goes up, and the player starts at the beginning of the level.
Once the game is completed, the player will be met with a screen with two collidable objects; one to restart the game, and the other to exit.
